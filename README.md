## Features

The ``LFPykernels`` package incorporates forward-model based calculations of causal spike-signal
impulse response functions for finite-sized neuronal network models.
The signals considered are low-frequency extracellular potentials ("local field potential" - LFP)
or current dipole moments (and by extension EEG and MEG like signals) that are
thought to mainly stem from synaptic currents and associated return currents.
The basic idea is that the effect of any spike event in each presynaptic
population on each signal type can be captured by single linearised multicompartment neuron
models representative of each population and simultaneously accounting for known distributions of
cells and synapses in space, distributions of delays, synaptic currents and associated return currents.

The present methodology is described in detail by [Hagen E et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010353).
The intended use for filter kernels predicted using ``LFPykernels`` is forward-model based signal predictions
from neuronal network simulation frameworks using simplified neuron representations like leaky integrate-and-fire
point neurons or rate-based neurons, but can also be used with biophysically detailed network models.

Let `$\nu_X(t)$` describe presynaptic population spike rates in units of spikes/dt
and `$H_{YX}(\mathbf{R}, \tau)$` predicted spike-signal kernels for the connections between presynaptic populations `$X$` and
postsynaptic populations `$Y$` the full signal may then be computed via the sum over linear convolutions:

``` math
V(\mathbf{R}, t) = \sum_X \sum_Y (\nu_X \ast H_{YX})(\mathbf{R}, t)
```

A more elaborate example combining kernel predictions with a spiking point-neuron network simulation is provided in the example notebook
<https://github.com/LFPy/LFPykernels/blob/main/examples/LIF_net_forward_model_predictions.ipynb>

## Usage

Example prediction of kernel function `$H(\mathbf{R},\tau)$` mapping spike events of a
presynaptic inhibitory population `$X==\mathrm{I}$` to extracellular potential contributions by a
postsynaptic excitatory population `$Y==\mathrm{E}$` (see <https://github.com/LFPy/LFPykernels/blob/main/examples/README_example.ipynb>):

## Documentation

The online Documentation of `LFPykernels` can be found here:
<https://lfpykernels.readthedocs.io/en/latest>

## Dependencies

`LFPykernels` is implemented in Python and is written (and continuously tested) for `Python >= 3.7` (older versions may or may not work).
The main `LFPykernels` module depends on ``LFPy`` (<https://github.com/LFPy/LFPy>, <https://LFPy.readthedocs.io>).

Running all unit tests and example files may in addition require `py.test`, `matplotlib`,
`LFPy`.

## Installation

### From development sources (<https://github.com/LFPy/LFPykernels>)

Install the current development version on <https://GitHub.com> using `git` (<https://git-scm.com>):

    git clone https://github.com/LFPy/LFPykernels.git
    cd LFPykernels
    python setup.py install  # --user optional

or using `pip`:

    pip install .  # --user optional

For active development, link the repository location

    pip install -e .  # --user optional

### Installation of stable releases on PyPI.org (<https://www.pypi.org>)

Installing stable releases from the Python Package Index (<https://www.pypi.org/project/lfpykernels>):

    pip install lfpykernels  # --user optional

To upgrade the installation using pip:

    pip install --upgrade --no-deps lfpykernels

## Docker

We provide a Docker (<https://www.docker.com>) container recipe file with LFPykernels etc.
To get started, install Docker and issue either:

    # build Dockerfile from GitHub
    docker build -t lfpykernels https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LFPy/LFPykernels/main/Dockerfile
    docker run -it -p 5000:5000 lfpykernels

or

    # build local Dockerfile (obtained by cloning repo, checkout branch etc.)
    docker build -t lfpykernels - < Dockerfile
    docker run -it -p 5000:5000 lfpykernels

If the docker file should fail for some reason it is possible to store the build log and avoid build caches by issuing

    docker build --no-cache --progress=plain -t lfpykernels - < Dockerfile 2>&1 | tee lfpykernels.log

For successful builds, the ``--mount`` option can be used to mount a folder on the host to a target folder as:

    docker run --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/opt/data -it -p 5000:5000 lfpykernels

which mounts the present working dirctory (``$(pwd)``) to the ``/opt/data`` directory of the container.
Try mounting the ``LFPykernels`` source directory for example (by setting ``source="<path-to-LFPykernels>"``).
Various example files can then be found in the folder ``/opt/data/examples/``
when the container is running.

Jupyter notebook servers running from within the
container can be accessed after invoking them by issuing:

    cd /opt/data/examples/
    jupyter-notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --port=5000 --no-browser --allow-root

and opening the resulting URL in a browser on the host computer, similar to:
<http://127.0.0.1:5000/?token=dcf8f859f859740fc858c568bdd5b015e0cf15bfc2c5b0c1>
